[ Group project for CMPT 276 Introduction to Software Engineering ]

The aim of this project is to develop a digital implementation of the classic Battleship board game. The game will allow two players to engage in a strategic battle by placing 1 their fleet of ships on a grid and attempting to sink their opponentâ€™s vessels by accurately guessing their locations. The game will include the basic gameplay mechanics such as ship placement, firing shots, and tracking hits and misses. The game will provide an intuitive user interface with appealing graphics and sound effects to enhance the gaming experience. Furthermore, this implementation of Battleship will have one game mode only: single-player versus an AI bot. In summary, this project will be a re-creation of the 1967 original game of Battleship, combining the nostalgia of the classic game with the allure of a modern digital adaptation.
